# Consumer Confidence v.s. Bank Performance

## The Problem
- Investigate how does US consumer confidence contribute to US bank’s performance.

## Data and Methods Used
- Bank Performance (Time Series Analysis & Analysis of Variance)
1) Bank’s Balance Sheet (E.g.Net Loan and Leases,Total Domestic Deposit Amount)
2) Performance ratio
3) Bank stock price
- Consumer Confidence (Correlation Analysis)
1) Consumer Sentiment Index v.s. Net Loan and Leases
2) Consumer Sentiment Index v.s. Total Domestic Deposit Amount

## Data Source
- Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
- Yahoo Finance
- The University of Michigan’s Survey of Consumers

## Key Findings
- The top 5 largest banks have diversified asset and have investor equity as capital rather than just
debt/liabilities. The failed bank, First Republic Bank’s asset was mainly from loans and leases. Investors and
consumers have more confidence in banks that have diversified assets/investments and capital leverage.
- JP Morgan Chase displays growth in their bank due to a higher return on assets ratio than their starting point
from when they fell in 2020.
- JP Morgan Chase showcased a higher level of stability and consistency compared to other banks. While not
as low-risk as Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase's performance indicates effective loan portfolio
management and a balanced approach to asset allocation which leads to a consistent consumer confidence
- There is a negative correlation between consumer sentiment index and total domestic deposit amount for all
banks mentioned in this project.
- The challenging economic conditions seem to have favored the growth and expansion of these larger banks,
enabling them to capture a larger market share and attract a greater number of consumers.
- There are significant differences in bank performance (i.e. bank stock prices) across the consumer
confidence groups (low/moderate/high)

## Recommendation for further study
- Multi regression analysis
1) Interest Rate
2) Inflation rate
- Different indicators of bank performance
1) Income statement
2) Off-balance sheet items
- Different indicators of consumer confidence
1) Unemployment rate
2) Income growth
3) Saving rate
